				<p>We worked with QVC to bring a host of new interactive features to their flagship iPad app, transforming it into an interactive TV experience.</p>

			<h1>The app</h1>
            <p>QVC will be able to surface fun, engaging content including the latest blogs, previewing new offers, information about their experts and reviews for on-air products. So whether viewers are loving the dress the presenter is wearing, would like the recipe of the smoothie being whizzed up on screen, or simply want to share their thoughts on Twitter or Facebook, this app will let them do all this and more.</p>

        <section class="objectives qvc">
            <h1>The opportunity</h1>
            <p>QVC is a digital retailer, and has been right from the start, so as a business they are always looking to improve their customer experience through the opportunities that new technology enables.</p>
            <p>Their customers are an engaged group and QVC value their close relationship with their customers. The new interactive features we developed for their iPad app will give them more opportunities to add value to the customers' shopping experience and build a two-way conversation with them throughout. The idea behind the project is to link up their traditional TV viewing with their online experience on a device that they know their customers use to shop with.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="objectives qvc">
            <h1>The challenges</h1>
            <p>On a project as ambitious as this, there are always technical challenges to overcome.</p>

            <p>The first challenge was to ensure that we could synchronize the interactivity of the app with the broadcast video stream in real-time. QVC broadcast live 16 hours a day, so it was critical to the success of the project that we could achieve a level of synchronization that would feel seamless to customers using the app.</p>

            <p>To meet this challenge, we selected Axonista, industry leading specialists in bringing interactive TV to mobile devices, and their Ediflo product. Out of the box, Ediflo was able to deliver a prototype demonstrating the synchronization capability, giving us the confidence that the larger goals could be achieved and allowing us to move on to the next set of challenges.</p>

            <p>The primary challenge of the project was to gather all of the rich data and content that we have at our disposal, but in disparate sources, at QVC and automatically bring it together in a way that puts it at the fingertips of our Production Assistant to push into the app at the right time to drive customer engagement. This content includes everything from detailed product information, media galleries and related videos to customer reviews, expert bios and, of course, social activity.</p>

            <p>We tapped into Axonista's creative and engineering teams to collaborate with our in-house engineers, designers and UX experts to integrate content from all of the various sources into the Ediflo backend from where it's delivered to a single, consistent and easy-to-use interface that fits seamlessly into the existing workflow of our own production team.</p>

            <p>We're delighted with how the app has turned out and the fact that the content experience is driven by our content team while being simple to use without being a time consuming and disruptive process. It's been a great collaborative project with a team of up to 20 people focused on solving some very difficult technical challenges all to bring a wonderful engaging user experience to QVC's customers.</p>

            <p>Because QVC is a broadcaster and a retailer, we are able to measure both engagement and sales for the experiences we deliver. We already know our iPad app is a successful sales channel and are confident that this will enhance that experience and the results it delivers.</p>

            <h1>Purchasing Items On Air</h1>
            <p>Viewers can use the QVC app to purchase items that are on air or that have been previously aired. Through collaboration with QVC it's not even possible for viewers to directly buy the presenter's outfit!</p>

			<h1>Methodology & Testing</h1>
			<p>We used C# / .Net client-side, XML, Silverlight and DOM development in this project, and we use XML and DOM in Roku channel development projects. We've developed 3player on Roku and Windows Phone as well for TV3. We provide a good design and development service that attracts repeat custom. IPTV, OTT and VOD are a key part of our product roadmap for our audience engagement CMS Ediflo, that we have developed ourselves and which supports a number of our companion viewing apps.

		<section class="product-details qvc">
			<h1>Product Details</h1>
			<p>In Second-screen mode the app provides the Standalone functionality plus additional content that is relevant to what they are watching right now on the primary screen, whether it’s live content or previously aired content. </p>
			<p>Social media content and engagement opportunities will be present in all three sections of the App, but within Watch these will be highlights of social content produced during that show.</p>
