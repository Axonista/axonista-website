			<h1>The Objective</h1>
            <p>Axonista worked with QVC to increase audience engagement by making the viewing experience truly interactive.  Our enterprise platform Ediflo is the driver behind the app that makes the videos interactive on a touchscreen device. </p>
           
            <p>Our client had very clear commercial objectives to make it easier for their audience to make informed purchase decisions, which ultimately would result in increased conversion rates in their flagship iPad app.  The app needed to allow customer interaction with QVC video, to share the rich content that is at the producer’s disposal to make their content come alive for their viewers.  Interactive features would include everything from detailed product information, related products, media galleries and related videos to customer reviews, expert bios and, of course, social activity.</p>

            <h1>Project Objectives</h1>
            <p>QVC is a digital retailer, and has been right from the start, so as a business they are always looking to improve their customer experience through the opportunities that new technology enables.</p>
            <p>Their customers are an engaged group and QVC value their close relationship with their customers. The new interactive features we developed for their iPad app will give them more opportunities to add value to the customers' shopping experience and build a two-way conversation with them throughout. The idea behind the project is to link up their traditional TV viewing with their online experience on a device that they know their customers use to shop with.</p>

            <h1>Purchasing Items On Air</h1>
            <p>Viewers can use the QVC app to purchase items that are on air or that have been previously aired. Through collaboration with QVC it's not even possible for viewers to directly buy the presenter's outfit!</p>

            <h1>The Challenges</h1>
            <p>On a project as ambitious as this, there are always technical challenges to overcome and this was no different.

            To ensure that we could synchronize the interactivity of the app with the broadcast video stream in real-time. QVC broadcast live 16 hours a day, so it was critical to the success of the project that we could achieve a level of synchronization that would feel seamless to viewers using the app.</p>
            <p class="quote">To meet this challenge, we leveraged our in house CMS Ediflo. Out of the box, Ediflo was able to deliver a prototype demonstrating the synchronization capability, giving QVC the confidence that the larger goals could be achieved and allowing us to move on to the next set of challenges. - Daragh Ward, CTO Axonista</p>

            <p>The primary challenge of the project was to gather all of the rich data and content that QVC had at their disposal, but in disparate sources, at QVC and automatically bring it together in a way that puts it at the fingertips of their Production Assistant to push into the app at the right time to drive customer engagement. </p>

            <p class="quote">Axonista's creative and engineering teams collaborated with QVC in-house engineers, designers and UX experts to integrate content from all of the various sources into the Ediflo backend from where it's delivered to a single, consistent and easy-to-use interface that fits seamlessly into the existing workflow of their own production team.</p>

            <p>‘We're delighted with the fact that the content experience is driven by our content team while being simple to use without being a time consuming and disruptive process. It's been a great collaborative project with a team of up to 20 people focused on solving some very difficult technical challenges all to bring a wonderful engaging user experience to QVC's customers’  </p></div>

			<h1>Methodology & Testing</h1>
			<p>We used C# / .Net client-side, XML, Silverlight and DOM development in this project, and we use XML and DOM in Roku channel development projects. We've developed 3player on Roku and Windows Phone as well for TV3. We provide a good design and development service that attracts repeat custom. IPTV, OTT and VOD are a key part of our product roadmap for our audience engagement CMS Ediflo, that we have developed ourselves and which supports a number of our companion viewing apps.

			<h1>Product Details</h1>
			<p>In Second-screen mode the app provides the Standalone functionality plus additional content that is relevant to what they are watching right now on the primary screen, whether it’s live content or previously aired content. </p>
			<p>Social media content and engagement opportunities will be present in all three sections of the App, but within Watch these will be highlights of social content produced during that show.</p>
