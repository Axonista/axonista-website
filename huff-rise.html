            <p>We have worked on a redesign of the current Huff Rise website in order to deliver this experience in the best way possible.</p>

        <section class="rise-section one">
          <header><h2>Effectively Identifying Our Objectives</h2>
            <p>We've thought extensively about how users interact with video and the best way
            to present this online. We have worked on a redesign of the current Huff Rise website in order to deliver this
            experience in the best way possible.</p>
          </header>
            <ul class="objectives columns-3">
            	<li>
                <i class="icon icon-tablet"></i>
            		<h3>Mobile First</h3>
            		<p>We thought starting with mobile was the most important decision in order to create a consistent flow for users on all devices as many users will be most likely to use this medium for viewing video.</p>
            	</li>
            	<li>
                <i class="icon icon-video"></i>
            		<h3>Video Behaviour</h3>
            		<p>One of the main design elements that was implemented into desktop was that of the scrolling video behaviour in order for users to fully engage with the video they are watching.</p>
            	</li>
            	<li>
                <i class="icon icon-address"></i>
            		<h3>Content Discovery</h3>
            		<p>A category menu was implemented into a hamburger within the new design in order for users to easily choose from and discover new content by just scrolling.</p>
            	</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="rise-section two">
          <header><h2>Current Issues With HuffPost Rise</h2>
            <p>Below are the goals that we considered to be the most important for the redesign and an enabler for shaping every design decision we made during the process. </p>
          </header>

          <ul>
            <li><i class="icon-circle"></i>Navigation causing clutter on homepage</li>
            <li><i class="icon-circle"></i>Main content was no divided up in uniform which disturbed the flow</li>
            <li><i class="icon-circle"></i>Newsletter section lacked affordance as it appeared like an advertisement</li>
            <li><i class="icon-circle"></i>Columned content gave users impression that all videos were advertisements</li>
            <li><i class="icon-circle"></i>Page loader slowed down navigation between pages</li>
            <li><i class="icon-circle"></i>Footer contained most important navigation for the website</li>
            <li><i class="icon-circle"></i>Hamburger navigation contained less important information for the user</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="rise-section three">
          <header><h2>Our Solution to Improve User Experience</h2>
            <p>We broke down the current design and tried to understand the importance of each section in the eyes of users. A new flow was created for the site in order to maximise time spent on the website and inform users effectively.</p>
          </header>

					<div id="solution-one">
						<img id="left" src="assets/images/case-studies/rise/screen-1.png" />

						<div id="solution-content"><h2>Improved nagivation for users to explore <span>categories</span></h2><p>Condensed navigation to enable a fast user experience for video</p></div>

					</div>

					<div id="solution-two">
						<img id="right" src="assets/images/case-studies/rise/screen-1.png" />

						<div id="solution-content"><h2>Continue watching video while <span>browsing</span> </h2><p>Condensed navigation to enable a fast user experience for video</p></div>
					</div>
        </section>

        <section class="rise-section four">
          <header><h2>Designing Rise in a Responsive Way</h2>
            <p>Starting with mobile gave us to opportunity to map out a flow that users can experience in a consistant way. In doing this we kept the design fluid from mobile to tablet and finally to desktop.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/case-studies/rise/screen-3.png" />

            <div id="align-right"><h2>Enjoy a new way of discovering content</h2><p>With the redesign of HuffPost Rise, users can now enjoy a new way of experiencing watching video across all devices.</p></div>
