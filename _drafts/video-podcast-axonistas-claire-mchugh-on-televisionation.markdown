Axonista’s very own Claire McHugh recently joined Televisionation's Tracy Swedlow to discuss how Axonista is powering the interactive video apps for Sinclair Broadcast, Waterbear and QVC amongst many others.

Over the course of a wide-ranging 30 minute interview, Claire got a chance to talk about how Axonista helped Oxfam Ireland “pivot to virtual” with Fashion Relief TV. She also gave a sneak preview of a new version of Ediflo coming in September aimed specifically at smaller OTT operators. Axonista is incredibly grateful to have been able to work with some truly inspirational organizations in recent times. During this interview, Claire got a chance to talk in depth about the stories behind those projects.

## Exploring the advanced television industry in the COVID era

Televisionation is a new video/audio podcast from InteractiveTV Today (ITVT). Founded in 1998 by Tracy Swedlow, InteractiveTV Today is the most widely read and trusted source for news and analysis of the interactive/multi-platform television space. Televisionation, which was first launched on March 30th at the early stages of the lockdown, explores how the advanced television industry is overcoming the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, there have been over 50 episodes of the show with “prominent figures in the advanced television” industry. Previous guests have included; **Rose Adkins Hulse**, CEO of ScreenHits TV. **Gerrit Niemeijer**, CTO of Ampersand (formerly NCC Media), a data-driven TV ad sales and technology company, co-owned by Comcast, Charter and Cox. **Yvette Kanouff**, winner of the Television Academy's 2020 Lifetime Achievement Emmy for her work in television technology at Time Warner's Full Service Network, SeaChange, Cablevision and Cisco. **Rob Gabel**, Co-Founder and CEO of social-video measurement and analytics company, Tubular Labs. Also on the show in May were **Scott Ehrlich and Rob Weisbord** of Sinclair Broadcast Group, an organisation that Axonista has worked with extensively in the past.
