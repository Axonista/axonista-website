*What’s The Holy Grail of recommendations? And why users are becoming frustrated.*

We spend a lot of time discussing content discovery, it is after all a significant aspect of creating a video on demand platform. The conversation inevitably leads to personalisation. To display content based on a particular user’s interests or viewing habits.

This certainly seems like the best approach when trying to order a content library that’s particularly large. How to give users the power to find content they’ll love, whether they know it exists or not?

## **What happens when there’s nothing to watch?**

A user will visit a platform because they’re interested in some aspect of the content. When they’re finished watching that content, they likely stick around to see what else might peak their interest. Then the scrolling game begins...

If you’re anything like me, you know what it feels like to endlessly scroll through a content platform in search of “something”. Maybe you find “something”, maybe you don’t.

The thrill of the hunt is a concept that doesn’t last long in this domain. It quickly gets replaced with the frustration of not finding something to watch.

## **The Holy Grail**

Imagine for a moment we could perfectly customise a library for each user’s personal taste and preference. So they could enjoy it in descending order of derived entertainment value. Allowing content providers to bask in the highest possible customer engagement and satisfaction.

Delivering the right content, at the right time, to each and every user sounds like a near impossible task. This is where recommendation engines are suppose to come in.

These engines work behind the scenes to order content based on the information it can ascertain from a user. The more sophisticated ones usually work something like this…

To begin with, a user might select a handful of their favourite shows. Then every relevant interaction is recorded as they use the platform. Such as how much time they spend watching a certain genre of film, or the rating they gave a series.

An algorithm processes this data, compares it to other users, and suggests content you’re likely to enjoy. The more data collected, the smarter it becomes, and the better its recommendations.

## **So why are so many people unhappy?**

Despite Netflix being the standard that many platforms aspire to, users still complain about their recommendations. Even with all the data they have, their platform still suggests content we’d never watch.

Why is this happening? We have a couple of theories that may shed light onto these shortcomings. And perhaps open the door to thinking about ways to solve these problems through design.
