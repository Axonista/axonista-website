*With 2 awards, 1.3 million plays and more than 150,000 yearly users in 6\+ countries, the interactive IFI Player app, powered by Ediflo, showcases the Irish Film Institute's extensive Irish film collection anytime, anywhere.*

The Irish Film Institute is Ireland’s national cultural institution for film. It provides audiences throughout Ireland and around the world with access to the finest independent, Irish and international cinema.

# The Challenge

With over 30,000 cans of film preserved in the IFI Irish Film Archive, the Irish Film Institute recognized the opportunities recent technology advancements created for it to grow its audience and the public's access to its archive collections. The IFI was interested in expanding its content distribution capabilities by creating a suite of video apps accessible on OTT devices and platforms so that people could find and engage with their content anywhere, anytime.

> **“This has been transformative for us. Instead of our 30,000 cans of film and 10,000 broadcast tapes being held in controlled vaults, the material is now real and vibrant and curated for people in a way that is easy to navigate on their chosen device” - Ross Keane, IFI Director**

# Our Solution

### Delivering Innovation to Market Fast

The IFI Player applications are powered by Ediflo, Axonista’s interactive video CMS, which gives organizations the tools to distribute, manage, curate, and customize video content. Using Ediflo, the IFI was able to launch a suite of rich immersive video apps within a matter of weeks, on the App Store, Google Play, Android, Amazon TV, and Roku.

> **“The IFI has found and saved so many important stories, that have so much cultural significance for Irish people and historians everywhere. The challenge is to ensure these stories can be told, retold, and shared with a global audience, using modern storytelling tools that showcase them in their best light.” - Claire McHugh, CEO of Axonista**

The IFI Player was designed to provide an engaging and interactive video experience for audiences worldwide. The app currently hosts 629 films, including feature-length documentaries, short films, travelogues, newsreel footage, and more.

Using the IFI player, viewers can interact with the IFI’s video content like never before with various types of interactive overlays that allow for in-app content discovery such as timelines and supplemental content.

Using Ediflo’s powerful curation tools the IFI was able to create exclusive curated playlists containing behind-the-scenes commentary from the IFI’s archivists, telling the story of the history of the collection, and how films were brought back to life.
